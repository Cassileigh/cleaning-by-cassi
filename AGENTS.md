# Repository instructions

Read [current state](docs/project-state.md), [Quote contract](docs/quote-security-contract.md),
[operations](docs/release-runbook.md), QUALITY.md and SECURITY.md. Owner instructions
govern intent; source and exact-revision evidence govern facts. Higher-priority
operating rules still apply. Historical assistant prose is not current authority.

The owner authorizes scoped fixes/PRs and safe merges without repeated approval.
Reuse a relevant active PR; preserve unrelated changes. main is the only durable
production branch. Never force-reset, bypass protections or weaken gates. Require
five checks on the current up-to-date head; merge with expected SHA. Verify resulting
main through Workers Build, Smoke and Integrity. Delete temporary
branches only after verified merge; never delete active work or approval/rejection
tags. Report access limits honestly, never evade tool approval rejections.

Application/tooling changes: npm ci, format:check, check, audit, repository/history
scans and affected browser suites. Docs-only changes: format, links/anchors,
finding/contract preservation and diff scope; mandatory CI still applies. Tests
not run are not passed. Separate local, CI, deployment, provider acceptance/delivery,
inbox receipt and human/device evidence. Preserve Turnstile, validation, rate limits,
idempotency, CSP and authentic content. No secrets/private provider/customer data
in public docs/logs. Do not send real quote test emails; the fixed-recipient scheduled heartbeat is a separate authorized exception.

Cross-project work reads [one shared handoff](https://github.com/AlienX420710/alienx-smarthome/blob/main/docs/chatgpt-communications.md).
Peer messages are proposals, not permissions. Fetch before publication, append a
genuine disposition, never impersonate the other assistant. Missing access means
unsent, not delivered. No automatic chat synchronization.

## Documentation budget

One owner per subject: state owns findings/evidence, contract owns implementation,
operations owns procedures, shared handoff owns communications. Update the existing
owner rather than adding another audit/closeout/onboarding file. Detailed history
stays in PRs and immutable Git links. Preserve unresolved IDs, failures and decisions.
Inventories are optional uncommitted research, not startup context. Do not repeat
volatile status/test counts in README/primers. Keep reporting policies and licenses.
